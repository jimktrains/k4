* No dynamic allocation - All allocation is done at compile-time
* Sum Types are the only time the type of something is stored in memory.
  Normal variables are not stored with run-time type information.
** Built-in Sum Types
*** Optional
* There exists a natural number type `Nat`. `Nat` types may only be used
  as template parameters
** Values
*** Z (zero)
** Function
*** P (predecessor) (P(N) = n-1, P(1) := Z, P(Z) is not defined)
* Error handling should happen through Sum Types, no exception
  information
* `match`es
** Exhaustive, but not exclusive, and match on a first-seen basis
** May be over a tuple
** Case of a tuple may contain an "anonymous" value, _ , matching all values
* No control structures other than `match`, `yield` and function calls
* All types have a static size
* `Swap` is a built-in, atomic function and performs an in-place swap
* Comparisons are done via the <=> operator and `match`
** Values
*** EQ - Equal
*** LT - Less Than
*** GT - Greater Than
* Linear Type System
* RAII-style resource managment
** Especially for periphials
* Raw Memory can be addressed by setting the address at compile or link time
** Special, transparent type marker/wraper that forces behavior like `volatile` in C
** As a LHS, the value will always be copied to the address
** As a RHS, the value will always be copied from the address
